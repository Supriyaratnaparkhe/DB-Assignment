Q.1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans: The type of relationship between the Product and Product_Category tables is a many-to-one relationship, where many products can belong to one product category. This is indicated by the foreign key category_id in the Product table referencing the primary key id in the Product_Category table.

Q.2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans: there are a few ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it:
1) Not Null Constraint: we can add a NOT NULL constraint on the category_id column in the "Product" table. This would prevent products from being inserted without a category assigned.
2) Foreign Key Constraint:  we can add a foreign key constraint on the category_id column in the "Product" table that references the id column in the "Product_Category" table. 
This would ensure that the category_id value in the "Product" table always refers to an existing category in the "Product_Category" table.
3) Default Category: we can set a default value for the category_id column in the "Product" table. This default value could be a category like "Uncategorized" or "Other". 
This way, even if a product is inserted without explicitly specifying a category, it would still have a valid category assigned.
